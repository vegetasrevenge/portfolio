        <p>
          Born and raised in the Pineywoods of East Texas, hard work was the cornerstone of his upbringing. <br>
          A love of music (he might have sang "My Heart Will Go On" a few times as a child) led him to play the trumpet in band. <br>
          Talent didn't come to him quickly, yet hard work and passion carried him to a rewarding career as a band director. <br>
          Many hats he wore, such as: brass instructor, orchestra teacher, color guard director, middle school director, and occasional therapist. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, he comes to you as an aspiring developer! He specializes in Java, but has experience with front-end design with HTML/CSS and Javascript. <br>
          What has not changed is his passion for great results through vision and that East Texas work ethic. <br>
